Observation for this agent!
Games with low branching factor but hard strategies require more matches
Games with high branching factor but easy strats require more agents to play against

connect4 require about 3-4 agents but more batches in order to become stringer (aboud 1000 batches and 600 matches each)
5x5 however dosen't do that good with only 4 agents for example
